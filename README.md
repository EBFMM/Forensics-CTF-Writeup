# Forensics-CTF-Writeup

## Objective

The Forensics/Hard Disks category of a CTF, typically consists of analyzing digital artifacts from storage devices. Challenges may involve recovering deleted files or analyzing file systems. The objective in this challenge is to identify specific evidence within registry files. Some important background knowledge needed is a solid understanding of file systems and forensic analysis techniques. More importantly how to move throughout file systems easily to quickly search and assess key information. This category relates to my experience within the Ethical Hacking course, particularly the topics of incident response and forensic analysis. The lab 'Scanning, Enumeration, and Vulnerability Analysis' in the course covered a similar topic to this CTF problem. To describe, reconnaissance is conducted to gather essential information and the Windows Registry can be categorized as a database.

## Introduction To The Problem

We are to download the registry files provided to determine the current version of Firefox. To begin, I plan to use the command line tool regshell to view the software registry in greater detail. I will select to view the software instead of system or security because the question is to determine the current version of Mozilla Firefox. I plan to search deeper into this software registry because it should contain the information I am looking for.
